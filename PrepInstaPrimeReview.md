# PrepInsta Prime Review

My PrepInsta Prime Review is simple and worked for me, I took PrepInsta Prime subscription and got placed in 4 different companies - TCS Digital, Infosys SP (OnCampus) and Deloitte and Amazong (PrepInsta Referrals).

1. C/C++
2. Python
3. Basic Coding
4. Intermediate Coding
5. Data Structures
6. Competitive Coding
7. Machine Learning and AI
8. Aptitude
9. TCS Codevita

## PrepInsta Prime Subscription Model

The best part I liked about PrepInsta Prime was that you pay for one single subscription and get access to over **200+ courses**.
